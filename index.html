        <p>Hi there, My name is Samuel Woiye. Your run of the mill self-taught software developer. Born and
            and raised in Nakuru. Currently leaving in Kambi Somali centre near Bahati. I have a deep love 
            for teaching and learning new things and thats what brought me into the exciting world of software
            development giving me a deep dive into the whats, the whys and the hows of technology. In my free time 
            I usually inline skate, which is something of a hobby and a very fun skill  I actually taught myself to
            do after seeing someone doing it,I was hooked.  I also teach young kids from the age of 3 years how to skate
            and sometimes even adults. There is nothing more exciting like seeing a kid learning something new and getting
            that aha! moment its a very thrilling experience for both teacher and student.Technology is the other love of my
            life and it seems its going to be a very long long relationship, probably forever if I can help it. It all began 
            when I was but a kid, still discovering the world. My mom can tell you I was a very curious kid. Every toy I got 
            was just another mystery for me to solve, I just had to know how it work and sometimes tried to innovate it in my
            own childish ways. Since then it has only grown. I believe technology is going to change the world in more ways than
            we can imagine and I want to be at the forefront of that change. I have a passion for technology that cannot be quenched and 
            in those rare moments I feel like giving up I remember I quote from arthur buddhold, "follow your passion and success will follow
            you". Thus thats my story, not the end though but just a minuscule beginning to an ever growing story. The future is yet to come!</p>
